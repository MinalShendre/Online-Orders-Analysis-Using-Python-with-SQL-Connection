The "Online Orders Analysis Using Python with SQL Connection" project involves analyzing online order data to derive meaningful insights and support business decision-making. This project integrates Python for data analysis and visualization with a SQL database for data storage and querying, leveraging the strengths of both technologies.

Objectives:
Data Extraction: Connect to a SQL database to retrieve online order data.
Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Data Transformation: Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
Data Analysis: Conduct various analyses to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
Visualization: Create visual representations of the analysis results using Python's visualization libraries.

Key Components:
SQL Connection:Establish a connection to a SQL database using Python libraries such as pyodbc, sqlalchemy, or psycopg2.
Execute SQL queries to extract online orders data from relevant tables.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:Use Pandas for data manipulation.
Handle missing data through imputation or removal.
Detect and remove duplicate records.
Normalize and standardize data fields where necessary.

Data Visualization:Utilize Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create insightful and interactive visualizations.
Develop charts such as bar graphs, line plots, heatmaps, and pie charts to represent data findings.
Create dashboards for dynamic and comprehensive data presentations.

Technologies Used:
Python: For scripting and data analysis (Pandas, NumPy).
SQL: For database interactions and querying.
Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive development environment.
Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for creating visualizations.
